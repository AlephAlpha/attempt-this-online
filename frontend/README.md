This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

For development, create a `.env.local` file in this directory, and set the URL to the API. For basic testing, you can
just use the production ATO instance.

```
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_ATO_BASE_URL="https://ato.pxeger.com"
```
