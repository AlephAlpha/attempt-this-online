/* timeout - Start a command, and kill it if the specified timeout expires

   We try to behave like a shell starting a single (foreground) job,
   and will kill the job if we receive the alarm signal we setup.
   The exit status of the job is returned, or one of these errors:
     EXIT_TIMEDOUT      124      job timed out
     EXIT_CANCELED      125      internal error
     EXIT_CANNOT_INVOKE 126      error executing job
     EXIT_ENOENT        127      couldn't find job to exec

   Caveats:
     If user specifies the KILL (9) signal is to be sent on timeout,
     the monitor is killed and so exits with 128+9 rather than 124.

     If you start a command in the background, which reads from the tty
     and so is immediately sent SIGTTIN to stop, then the timeout
     process will ignore this so it can timeout the command as expected.
     This can be seen with 'timeout 10 dd&' for example.
     However if one brings this group to the foreground with the 'fg'
     command before the timer expires, the command will remain
     in the stop state as the shell doesn't send a SIGCONT
     because the timeout process (group leader) is already running.
     To get the command running again one can Ctrl-Z, and do fg again.
     Note one can Ctrl-C the whole job when in this state.
     I think this could be fixed but I'm not sure the extra
     complication is justified for this scenario.
